PROFESSIONAL DESCRIPTION:

Hey!

My name is Buddy “Jason” Deitz, and I’m an IT and tech student at Raritan Valley Community College.

This ReadMe section is required for my website development 1 course. I dedicate this final to my Mom, for always being so supportive. Even though it’s an entry level course, we learned a lot, especially about HTML and CSS. Here are a few examples of what we’ve learned: 
In the beginning, there was BOB the origami bird. BOB is no longer with us, but in his place, we used Figma to create an icon out of our initials. Getavataaars is where we designed our design clone avataaar; whose section also contains our name and where we’re from. We made a hamburger menu, which shows and hides a menu that allows a user to jump to certain sections on a page. This doubles as a nav bar, which is a text menu that changes color when you mouse over. Our biography section contains information about ourselves, such as hobbies, and what we’re currently up to. Throughout the project, we were taught how to accommodate for light mode and dark mode, device size, color contrast, accessibility, responsive design. Artistic design and formatting was also discussed, such as adding or embedding borders, the box model, a contact section, copyright info, C.R.A.P., and various forms of media. Along the way, we learned how to add, change, discover, edit, and resize pictures, videos, and text. We were also educated on how to find free and open-source content, and how to properly credit where we got them from. The discussions and ethical questions were eye-opening, and the games were super fun as well. Also discussed were how various hardware devices worked, such as web servers.

All of this wouldn’t possible without our instructions on how to work with and setup programs and websites like Visual Studio Code (with plugins), Github, Netlify, Google Fonts, Adobe Color, Unsplash, the HTML and CSS validators, CodePen, and more. As part of our contact us section, we learned how to integrate the back-end of form submission, and how to take that content and put it into an excel document. The inspector tool on Chrome and Firefox allowed us to look at any element, whether it was our website or not, and learn how certain things were done, and how to tweak it. One of the most frustrating but rewarding aspects of learning VS Code was learning to tweak code so that it flowed, as well as the overall design principles, such as file and folder structures, naming, linking, tables, that are expected in a web development context. 

I learned more about design and coding in this class than my entire graphic design associate’s degree, and my ongoing IT tech certificate. This class has also demystified coding and design in a way I never thought possible, and I'm no longer afraid of programming classes. 

Thank you to Penn medicine, for saving my life over 20 years apart with kidney transplants.

I’m in this class thanks to the generous support of the State of NJ on a work-training grant, and I’m truly grateful for the opportunity to take this course. 

I’m also incredibly thankful for the professors who made this course possible. Everything was incredibly well organized. Thank you so much!

COLOR SCHEME:

This website was designed with accessibility and color contrast in mind. 

All colors used for all elements:

Hex: #000000, #ffffff, #add8e6, #0000ff, #AD8F4C, #BDD3FF, #333333

RGB: 0, 0, 0, | 255, 255, 255 | 0, 0, 255 | 166, 43, 43 | 173, 216, 230 | 189, 211, 255 | 51, 51, 51

The theme for my website is beach meets utilitarian and accessibility. To do this, I mixed a brighter, sandy color for the overall background and tried to contrast it with larger, darker elements, like text. I think these brighter elements mixed with the sky-like blues well. I tried to keep the contrast at least 4.5-7+ for AA and AAA accessibility standards. I’m actually really happy with how my logo / favicon turned out, as it looks like a person’s face with sunglasses from the side; it really matches that beach vibe I was going for. Finally, while I would have preferred to create something more colorful than black and light, especially for text, the accessibility challenges we learned about and discussed made me err toward starker colors and contrast. Pre-final project, there were a lot of sections that didn't even meet the A disability contrast standard, so I had to overhaul a lot to correct that.

I would have loved a section in the course discussing how to talk about design elements in our readme, and linking pictures / examples to it. I'm genuinely not sure what to say besides the above, where I talk about theme.

This is where I got the original code for the hamburger menu, which I then edited / tinkered with.
