            <h2>Biography:</h2>
                <div> 
                    <p align="justify">
                    Hey! I'm Buddy "Jason" Deitz! Welcome to my website sandbox for website development 1! I was born and raised in Manhattan, New York City and have moved around a lot, spending most of my time in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. I've also lived in Pennsylvania and Iowa, and had extended stays in Ohio and Minesotta. I'm here on a work-training grant, and have had two kidney transplants. I'm very happy to be here!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p align="justify">
                    <p>I only have two semesters left in my computer support certificate at Raritan Valley Community College, and in that time hope to pick up as much tech knowledge as I can. I hope to pick up some work experience and professional certifications in my time here, and maybe make a few new friends and business connections. I'm a very hungry learner, and hope to continue to provide for my close friends and loved ones. My professional goal to start is in IT, but the more I learn about tech, the more I realize how much there is to learn. Truthfully, I don't know where I'll wind up, but I think my love of learning and cheerful personality will bring me far. I want to make the world a better place.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p align="justify">
                    <p>The theme for my website is beach meets utilitarian. To do this, I mixed a brighter, sandy color for the overall background and tried to contrast it with larger, darker elements, like text. I think these brighter elements mixed with the sky-like blues well. I tried to keep the contrast at least 4.5-7+ for AA and AAA accessibility standards. I’m actually really happy with how my logo / favicon turned out, as it looks like a person’s face with sunglasses from the side; it really matches that beach vibe I was going for. Finally, while I would have preferred to create something more colorful than black and light, especially for text, the accessibility challenges we learned about and discussed made me err toward starker colors and contrast. Pre-final project, there were a lot of sections that didn't even meet the A disability contrast standard, so I had to overhaul a lot to correct that.</p>

            <h1>An Excerpt From Pride and Prejudice</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>"From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”</p>
                    <p>“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.”</p>
                    <p>And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.</p>
                    <p>The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.</p>
                    <p>Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.</p>

            <h1>CSS Sprites:</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>CSS sprites put all the pictures together into one big picture, which can be used for:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Faster Page Loading: By reducing the number of HTTP requests, the total page loading time is reduced, resulting in a better user experience. A single bigger picture can be cached more successfully by browsers than several smaller images, resulting in speedier subsequent page loads. This also improves mobile performance by reducing the number of image requests, which is crucial for faster loading on slower mobile networks.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Logo Variations: If your site has multiple logo variations (e.g., different colors or styles), you can combine many little photos into a single bigger image. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As pictures, hover effects and transitions can be applied using CSS rules on the sprites. No JavaScript required! </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Lastly, for portfolio showing and resource sharing like you'd find on a brand's website.</p>

            <h1>Embedded Static Google Map Using iFrame</h1>
            <br>
                <div>
                    <p>This is a handy feature because it requires no Javascript, and iFrames, as we learned about in our embedding a youtube video lesson, is very easy to implament. They are important for reducing load times, and have consistent appearances. They are also compatible with most browsers and browser versions. Depending on your website host, you may have to pay once your site traffic hits a certain point. iFrames don't contribute to this limit, making them and similar functions a money-saver. There are two types of embedded maps: static and dynmamic. Static is essentially a static image of the location on Google Maps, versus dynamic which allows for more real time interaction and route planning.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are a lot of locations like restaurants, theaters, museums, etc., which don't include a variety of information, such as a Google Map, which would make it easier to find the location or parking. There are a lot of use cases for this sort of thing, and generally, it's not enough to include just the location of the place itself but also the best, cheapest, and safest place to park as well.</p>
