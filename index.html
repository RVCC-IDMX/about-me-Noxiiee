                    <p align="justify">
                    Hey! I'm Buddy "Jason" Deitz! I was born and raised in Manhattan, New York City and have moved around a lot, spending most of my time in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. I've also lived in Pennsylvania, Iowa, and New York, and New Jersey. I'm here on a work-training grant, and have had two kidney transplants. I'm very happy to be here!</p>
                    <p align="justify">
                    <p>I only have two semesters left in my computer support certificate at Raritan Valley Community College, and in that time hope to pick up as much tech knowledge as I can. I hope to pick up some work experience and professional certifications in my time here, and maybe make a few new friends and business connections. I'm a very hungry learner, and hope to continue to provide for my close friends and loved ones. My professional goal to start is in IT, but the more I learn about tech, the more I realize how much there is to learn. Truthfully, I don't know where I'll wind up, but I think my eager and cheerful personality will bring me far. I want to be supportive and help people.</p>

            <h2>An Excerpt From Pride and Prejudice</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>"From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”</p>
                    <p>“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.”</p>
                    <p>And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.</p>
                    <p>The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.</p>
                    <p>Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.</p>
